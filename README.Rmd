# AR-Attractor  

Using shipwreck fish assemblage data to test whether newly deployed artificial reefs act as **attractors** of fish from nearby natural reefs in the Gulf of Thailand.  
This repository covers only the *attractor* half of the broader **Attractor vs Producer** project by [Global Reef](https://global-reef.com).

---

## 🐠 Overview  
Artificial reefs are increasingly deployed to enhance fish abundance and biodiversity, yet whether they function primarily as **attractors** (concentrating existing fish from nearby reefs) or **producers** (creating new biomass) remains debated.  
This repository contains R scripts and data used to analyse attraction effects around new wreck deployments near Koh Tao, Thailand.

The complementary “producer” half of this project is hosted separately in [`AR-producer`](https://github.com/global-reef/AR-producer) and focuses on long-term productivity and recruitment processes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Quantify fish assemblage structure and abundance on newly deployed wrecks vs nearby natural reefs.  
- Test whether observed assemblages indicate attraction of existing reef fish.  
- Explore responses by **functional group** (e.g., grazers, invertivores, mesopredators, higher-trophic predators).  
- Provide management-relevant guidance for future AR deployments under Thailand’s DMCR program.

```
DATA/                   # cleaned and raw data (fish counts, site metadata)
00.RUN.R                # master script to reproduce full analysis
01.CLEAN.R              # data cleaning and preprocessing
02.EXPLORE.R            # exploratory summaries and visualizations
03.DIVERSITY.R          # diversity and assemblage metrics
04.FUNGROUPS.R          # functional group models
05.PAIRED.R             # paired comparisons: wreck vs reef
06.NMDS_BRAYCURT.R      # multivariate ordination (NMDS)
scratch.R               # testing / notes
AR_Attractor.Rproj      # R project file
```

Outputs (figures, tables, RDS objects) are generated within each script and can be directed to an `outputs/` folder.

## ⚙️ Getting started  
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/global-reef/AR-attractor.git
   ```
2. Open `AR_Attractor.Rproj` in RStudio.  
3. Run `01.CLEAN.R` to assemble cleaned data.  
4. Execute subsequent scripts (`02.*` → `06.*`) in order.  
5. All figures and summary tables will be created automatically.

---

## 📦 Dependencies  
Required R packages:
- **tidyverse** (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr)
- **vegan** (for NMDS and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities)
- **emmeans**, **glmmTMB**, **broom.mixed**, **performance** (for model evaluation)

Each script lists additional dependencies at the top.

---

## 📊 Outputs  
- Fish abundance summaries by site, date, and functional group  
- Diversity and NMDS ordination plots  
- Paired comparisons between wreck and reef sites  
- Figures for reporting to DMCR and Global Reef internal analyses

## 🔍 Relation to “Producer” work  
This repository isolates the *attractor* question:  
> Do new wrecks pull fish from existing reef systems, altering local assemblage balance?  

The **producer** repository will assess whether wrecks generate *new* fish biomass through recruitment and growth.

## Notes
-----

- Survey data are collected by Global Reef researchers based in Koh Tao, Thailand.
- Fieldwork and data processing are ongoing; results may be updated as more surveys are completed.
- This project contributes to understanding the ecological role of mid-shelf reef features in regional conservation planning.
